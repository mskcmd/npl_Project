This project is a cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that harnesses the power of MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and EJS. It features OpenAI integration, YouTube video processing, and responsive design for a seamless user experience.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Natural language processing using the `natural` library
- 🗄️ MongoDB database with TTL indexing
- 🖥️ Express.js server with EJS templating
- 🤖 OpenAI integration for advanced NLP tasks
- 🎥 YouTube video processing with `ytdl-core`
- 📱 Responsive CSS design for various screen sizes
- 🔐 Environment variable management with `dotenv`

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [OpenAI API key](https://openai.com/api/)
- [YouTube Data API key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-project.git
   cd nlp-project
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file and add your API keys and MongoDB URI:
   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

3. Start the server:
   npm start
   ```

## 📖 Usage

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
- Use the intuitive web interface to interact with the NLP features
- Process YouTube videos by entering video URLs
- Explore the various NLP capabilities powered by the `natural` library and OpenAI

## 🧩 Key Components

- **natural**: Used for tokenization and sentence splitting
- **openai**: Integration with OpenAI's powerful language models
- **ytdl-core**: YouTube video processing and information extraction
- **mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js
- **ejs**: Embedded JavaScript templating for dynamic content

## 💾 Database

The project leverages MongoDB with TTL (Time-To-Live) indexing for efficient data management. This ensures that processed data is automatically removed after a specified period, keeping the database lean and performant.

## 🎨 Responsive Design

The user interface is crafted with responsive CSS, ensuring a seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Our design philosophy prioritizes accessibility and user-friendliness.
